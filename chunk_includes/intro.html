<h3><p>1. Invitation Paragraph</h3><p>
<p>You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what participation will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. Thank you for reading this.</p>

<h3><p>2. What is the project's purpose?</h3><p>
<p>The purpose of the research is to better understand sentence processing. The results will be used to describe the mechanisms we use to understand sentences. The study will involve reading sentences, answaring yes/no questionss and performing Stroop task (which we will describe to you later). It should take under an hour to complete the entire study and there are no foreseeable risks. You may however find the task tiring or boring. In order to minimize this there are opportunities to take breaks for you to take a rest, if needed.</p>

<h3><p>3. Why have I been chosen?</h3><p>
<p>Exclusion criteria:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">Hearing impairment</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">Language impairment</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">Speech impairment</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">Age 18-50 years</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">Native English speaker (learned English in first few years of life)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">Normal or Corrected-to-normal vision</p>

<h3><p>4. Do I have to take part?</h3><p>
<p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part you will be given this information sheet to keep and be asked to provide consent through checking boxes. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without it affecting any benefits that you are entitled to (ie, job, studies etc). If you decide to withdraw prior to completing the study, the data will not be saved.</p>

<h3><p>5. What will happen to me if I take part?</h3><p>
<p>You will be asked to provide some demographic data (ie, gender, age etc) and then the language task will be described to you. You will be given a few practice trials after which you can ask any questions, should you have any. After the practice session you will be asked to complete the full task.</p>

<h3><p>6. What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h3><p>
<p>There are no foreseeable risks in participating in this study. You may however find the task tiring or boring. There will be opportunity for you to take breaks in order to minimize this.</p>

<h3><p>7. What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3><p>
<p>Whilst there are no immediate benefits for those people participating in the project, it is hoped that this work will contribute to science in helping us have a better understanding of language processing.</p>

<h3><p>8. What if something goes wrong?</h3><p>
<p>Should any concerns arise, you can contact the Principal Research, Andrea Santi: a.santi@ucl.ac.uk. If the concern is still not satisfactorily addressed, you can contact the Chair of the UCL Research Ethics Committee â€“ ethics@ucl.ac.uk</p>

<h3><p>9. Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?</h3><p>
<p>All the information that we collect about you during the course of the research will be kept strictly confidential. You will not be able to be identified in any ensuing reports or publications.</p>

<h3><p>10. Limits to confidentiality</h3><p>
<p>Please note that assurances on confidentiality will be strictly adhered to unless evidence of wrongdoing or potential harm is uncovered. In such cases the University may be obliged to contact relevant statutory bodies/agencies.</p>
<p>onfidentiality may be limited and conditional and the researcher has a duty of care to report to the relevant authorities possible harm/danger to the participant or others.</p>

<h3><p>11. What will happen to the results of the research project?</h3><p>
<p>The data collected in this research project will be presented at scientific conferences and published in scientific journals.</p>
