<h1><p>Instruction 2</h1></p>

<p>In reading comprehension trials, you will see a series of dashes representing the letters in each word, with spaces showing the gaps between words.</p>
<p>For every <b><font color="red">sentence</font></b>, each press of the <b>SPACE BAR</b> shows the next word and the previous word is hidden. That is, you will only see one word displayed at a time.</p>
<p>After each sentence you will be asked a simple <b><font color="red">question</font></b> about the sentence, to which you respond by pressing <b>button "1" for yes"</b> or <b>button "2" for no"</b> (this will be shown on the screen).
<p>Your task is to read the sentence as quickly as possible, while understanding it, as checked by the question. The computer will record the time taken for each press of the space bar and your answer to the questions.</p>
